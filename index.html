    <p>Hi, Players. I am a Champion form <em>Noxus</em>. Noxus is a powerful empire with a fearsome reputation. 
       To those beyond its borders, <strong> Noxus </strong> is brutal, expansionist, and threatening, yet those
       who look beyond its warlike exterior see an unusually inclusive society, where the strengths and talents of 
       its people are respected and cultivated. Its people were once a fierce reaver culture until they stormed the 
       ancient city that now lies at the heart of their empire. Under threat from all sides, they aggressively took 
       the fight to their enemies, pushing their borders outward with every passing year. This struggle for survival 
       has made the Noxians a deeply proud people who value strength above all, though that strength can manifest by 
       many different means. Anyone can rise to a position of power and respect within Noxus if they display the 
       necessary aptitude, regardless of social standing, background, homeland, or wealth.
