    <p>Hi, Players. I am Darius<em>"Noxus will rise."</em>. 
        
    <p>Noxus is a powerful empire with a fearsome reputation. 
       To those beyond its borders, <strong> Noxus </strong> is brutal, expansionist, and threatening, yet those
       who look beyond its warlike exterior see an unusually inclusive society, where the strengths and talents of 
       its people are respected and cultivated. Its people were once a fierce reaver culture until they stormed the 
       ancient city that now lies at the heart of their empire. Under threat from all sides, they aggressively took 
       the fight to their enemies, pushing their borders outward with every passing year. This struggle for survival 
       has made the Noxians a deeply proud people who value strength above all, though that strength can manifest by 
       many different means. Anyone can rise to a position of power and respect within Noxus if they display the 
       necessary aptitude, regardless of social standing, background, homeland, or wealth.</p>

       <h1 id="Dogma" class="Section-heading">Noxus Dogma</h1>

       <p><em>"A Noxian knows who he is, and what he must do."</em>.- Swain</p>

    <p>Noxians respect strength above all things, and the only way to remain strong
       is to be constantly tested. They relish the opportunity to compete with one
       another, since to not be challenged is to grow weak, and even those at the
       peak of power must always seek new ways to challenge themselves... or they
       will not remain in power for long. It is not just physical or martial strength that
       Noxians admire - those who demonstrate expertise in politics, craftsmanship,
       trade, and magic all help to create a stronger Noxus.
    </p>

    <p>Anyone can prosper in Noxus, no matter their background, so long as they
        have the strength of will, and the drive to succeed. The warlord Darius is a
        perfect example of this, rising from nothing to become one of the empire's
        most powerful leaders. Despite this meritocratic ideal, the old noble families
        still wield considerable power at the heart of the empire, and some fear that 
        he greatest threat to Noxus comes not from its enemies, but from within.

        As Noxus expands and defeats neighboring cultures and cities, it offers the
        conquered people a choice; swear loyalty to Noxus and be judged solely on
        your worth, or be destroyed. This is not subterfuge or any kind of ruse; the
        Noxians are as good as their word, and many who have embraced their 
        conquerors' way of life find their prospects greatly improved. But those who 
        refuse to bend the knee are crushed without mercy.
